# Event Scheduler and Conflict Detector

This project is a simple web-based Event Scheduler that allows users to manage daily events. The application includes features to detect conflicting events and suggest resolutions. Additionally, users can edit existing events for better schedule management.

## Features

1. **Add/Edit Events**
   - Users can view, edit, and update events via a graphical interface.

2. **Conflict Detection**
   - Detects overlapping events in the schedule.

3. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Suggests alternative time slots for conflicting events within user-defined working hours.

4. **Interactive Interface**
   - Events are displayed in an organized list with the ability to edit or view conflict details.

5. **Working Hours**
   - Automatically considers user-defined working hours (default: 08:00 - 18:00) for scheduling and suggestions.

## File Structure

```
|-- index.html            # Main HTML file containing the structure of the interface
|-- styles.css            # CSS file for styling the interface
|-- script.js             # JavaScript file for application logic
|-- README.md             # Documentation for the project
